#raport

##time spent
- 6 hours

##things done
- Implemented linked list for boolean values
- Implemented bit storage for writing and reading bits and interpreting them as a string
- Created tests for added code
- Created documentation for added code

##program advances
- The container for bit storing and text interpreting has been implemented
- All data structures so far have been implemented without java libraries

##todo next
- Code the actual algorithm and the dictionary it needs

##learning
- Learned that bugs can also appear in tests - the problem was not in program code but in tests
- Java feels very klunky with bit manipulation. I miss C/C++ capabilities with malloc, unsigned ints, reinterpret casts..
- It is difficult to have everything you want and need while coding it yourself and maintaining fast code
- Many algorithm examples describe the algorithms too generally and fail when implemented in reality

##unclear
- Cobertura reports stuff that doesnt exist ?
