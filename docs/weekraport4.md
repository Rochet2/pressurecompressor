##time spent
- 16 hours

##things done
- small pivot for implementing LRU cache and then scrapping it for use of just clearing the dictionary
- also small pivot for doing packing for bytes instead of consentrating on strings.
- created more of the documentations

##program advances
- Found bugs in the algorithm and fixed them
- implemented dictionary clearing when it is full
- now packing bytes instead of strings only

##todo next
- write more documentations
- create some statistics about algorithm use. Images?
- Start on Huffman compression

##learning
- Faced problems using integers. Too used to using unsigned integers and java doesnt have them.
- Found out the IDE on my linux laptop cannot debug tests but on my windows PC I can.
- checked the time complexities through running some inputs

##unclear
- Not sure what I need to create for the O notation graphs and other.
- not sure what to write in testing document
