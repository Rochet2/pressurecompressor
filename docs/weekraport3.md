##time spent
- 12 hours

##things done
- See implemented algorithm itself for compressing and decompressing
- Everything tested and commented

##program advances
- Implemented the actual LZW algorithm to compress ASCII text only
- Implemented string utilities to centralize string operations - especially the ones that require a specific encoding

##todo next
- Fine tune the existing algorithm
- Start on Huffman compression

##learning
- Learned that Java uses UTF-8 by default
- Learned that UTF-8 is variable length in bytes
- Learned that ASCII is 7 bits but uses 8 bits when stored
- Learned that Java writes text with ASCII coding when non ASCII variables given
- Learned a bit about how LZW works and what kind of possible optimization and other possibilities there are

##unclear
- Unclear why cobertura keeps on complaining. Might just use pit only
