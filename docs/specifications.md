#Specifications

- Solving packing and unpacking problem of text without data loss
- Likely implementing "Lempel–Ziv–Welch" and if enough time "Huffman coding" packing algorithm
- Selected algorithms are lossless and are nicely complatible with each other, so they suit the needs nicely for text packing
- Program input is any text and output is packed text. Input can also be packed text which is then unpacked to original form
- Time complexity goal is O(n): http://stackoverflow.com/a/6189930
