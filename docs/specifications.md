#Specifications

- Solving packing and unpacking problem of file without data loss
- Implementing some variation of "Lempel–Ziv–Welch" and if enough time "Huffman coding" algorithm
- Selected algorithms are lossless and are nicely compatible with each other, so they suit the needs nicely for file packing.
- Program input is any file and output is a file. Depending on program switches the data is either packed or unpacked.
- Time complexity goal is O(n): http://stackoverflow.com/a/6189930
