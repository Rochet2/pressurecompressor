##time spent
- 12 hours

##things done
- Fixing stuff, document stuff, profile stuff, preview other ppls stuff
- created some time complexity evaluation based on pseudocode
- made first release
- improved readme so ppl can run the program
- renewed the program input handling code

##program advances
- Found bugs in the algorithm and fixed them
- implemented some tests to generate profiling data
- renamed stuff for clearer understanding of algorithm
- I believe the algorithm is finally "bugfree"

##todo next
- improve documentations
- generate javadoc
- improve program clearness by renaming variables and such
- prepare for demo
- Start on Huffman compression still?

##learning
- Used some bad pseudocode as example for my algorithm. Riddled with bugs that I have been fixing most of the weeks so far.
- learned that I can change the jar output name.
- Learned that other ppl dont use maven projects. ... why :/?

##unclear
- Comments on the O notation and profiling. See the testing document and the implementations documents.
- if something seems missing, do tell.
